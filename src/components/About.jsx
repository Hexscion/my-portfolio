                        I’m a developer based in <strong>Mangalore, India</strong>. Whether it’s crafting responsive websites, 
                        optimizing performance, or debugging those elusive bugs, I’m in my element.
                    </p>

                        I’m also the go-to person for all things computer-related in my circle. When friends, family, or colleagues 
                        encounter cryptic error messages or tangled cables, they know who to call.

                    <p>I’m excited to share my work with you, and hope you enjoy browsing my portfolio.</p>
